# 👋 Hi, I'm Suhita Anubha

🎓 I'm a junior at **Indiana University Bloomington**, pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science** with a specialization in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
📌 GPA: 3.98 | Global Engagement & Luddy Direct Admit Scholar

## 💻 Skills
- **Languages:** C++, Python, Java, C, R, Racket, SQL 
- **Tools & Databases:** VS Code, IntelliJ, R Studio, DrRacket, Git, PostgreSQL


## 🚀 Projects
### ❤️ Predicting Heart Disease Using Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning
- Developed a binary classification model to detect heart disease using the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**.
- Implemented and optimized a **Decision Tree Classifier**, then improved performance with a custom **3-tree ensemble** using majority voting.
- Performed **data preprocessing**, including missing value imputation and feature scaling (`SimpleImputer`, `StandardScaler`).
- Tuned hyperparameters via **GridSearchCV** with **4-fold cross-validation**.
- Boosted model accuracy from **65.8% (unoptimized)** to **86.8% (optimized)**.
- Tools: `Python`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`
- [📄 Dataset Source (UCI Cleveland)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)



### 🧠 Alzheimer’s Disease Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors
- Built a classification model to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer’s Disease using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
- Preprocessed a dataset of over 2,000 medical records with 35 features; performed **feature selection using ANOVA F-scores** and **standardized** inputs for distance-based learning.
- Tuned the hyperparameter `k` using **4-fold cross-validation**, increasing accuracy from **54% to 84%**.
- Improved recall for the minority class (demented patients) from **0.23 to 0.67**, reducing false negatives by over 50%.
- Tools: `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
